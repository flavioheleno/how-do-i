# Introduction

This book is not intended to be an exhaustive coverage of internal details of PHP, but rather a quick and easy reference
for developers that are learning, exploring or even contributing to PHP itself.

For a more comprehensive and detailed write of how PHP works internally, the best available resource (besides the PHP
source code itself), is [The PHP Internals Book](https://www.phpinternalsbook.com).
